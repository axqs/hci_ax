# HCI_AX
Team project for fourth year Human Computer Interaction class at the University of Glasgow:

Our job was to make and demonstrate an interactive system that allows people to monitor, understand or support good health—or lets us understand and work against bad health—or otherwise uses health data to make our lives more enjoyable or productive. This year, we have decided to focus on the perhaps too obvious topic of COVID, and its spread and key risk factors, as documented by institutions such as the World Health Organisation, the EU and the UK government:
* https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data 
* https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data
* https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-statistics-and-analysis

How To Run:
1. python manage.py makemigrations
